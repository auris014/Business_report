# 1. How many animals have been released/rehomed/euthanised/currently_in_care from 1999 to 2018 in Australia? How the outcomes' percentage levels have changed in dogs,cats and wildlife ? 

###COMPARISON ANIMAL OUTCOMES 

```{r}

###COMPARISON OUTCOMES DOGS

```{r}

# 2. Identify how the number of euthanized wildlife animals has changed during the last decade? Does it have a significant change through years?

```{r}
